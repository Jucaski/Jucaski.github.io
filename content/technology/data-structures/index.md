### Notes from the book A common-Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms by Jay Wengrow


#### Data
"Data is all types of information"

The data structures is how the data is organized

Data structures are use in 4 ways called operators:
- Read
- Search
- Insert
- Delete

#### How do we measure the speed of an operation?
Not in terms of pure time, but instead in how many steps it take


### Arrays
- **Read**: The arrays can read in one step because we have the exact address. If we need the index 4, the computer search where the array begins and then add 4.

Memory in this case is sequential.
When the computer check one cell at a time is called linear search.
