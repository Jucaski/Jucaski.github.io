## Visual Studio Configuration

First of all youu need to install some basic plugins in your visual studio code.

#### 1. **Live Server**

#### 2. Bracket Pair colorizer 
Only if you don't already have a good theme on your VSC that do that for you

#### 3. Prettier
A formatter, only install it if you need it.

### Extra
Messy things you have to order later on

- Only writing the exclamation point in visual code you can add the entire html structure

- For example if you want to use an specific font from google fonts, you can copy and use the link in your html file but you can use the @import without the < script > part in your css and it will work the same as importing it in th html file

- You have to investigate what vh means in the css height

- You have to investigate about the .panel:nth-of-type(4) in the @media 

- When you only write for example .container and the press enter in visual code, vc enter a div with the class container

- Also when you write .container#progress, vs add a div with class container and an id progress :)

- You need to investigate about the content in the ::before in the porgress number

- You need to investigate about the root and the global variables in the progress steps

- Investigate about the differences between the == and ===
