## Data analysis
The collection, transformation, and organization of data in order to draw conclusions, make predictions, and drive informed decision-making.

## Data analyst
Someone who collects , transforms, and organizes data in order to help make informed decisions.

### Data Analytics
The science of data

## Processes for data analysis:
- Ask
- Prepare
- Process
- Analyze
- Share
- Act

### Different questions like:
- "How can we get customers to recycle our product packaging?"
to:
- "What design features will make our packaging easier to recycler?"

The process you need to cover:
 1. Foundations: Data
 2. Ask questions to make data-driven decisions
 3. Prepare data for exploration
 4. Process data from dirty to clean
 5. Analyze data to answer questions
 6. Share data through the art of visualization
 7. Data analysis with R programming
 8. Data analytics capstone project: Complete case study

#### Foundations: Data:
1. Introducing data analytics and analytical thinking
2. The wonderful world of data (data lifecycle, data analysis process)
3. Set up your data analytics toolbox
4. Become a fair and impactful data professional



Computer+ Your brain + Your skills + Your traits = Success

> Turning data into insights

#### Human resources analytics or workforce analytics
People analytics is the practice of collecting and analyzing data on the people who make up a company’s workforce in order to gain insights to improve how the company operates


## The six phases of data analysis:
### Asky
You’ll work to understand the challenge to be solved or the question to be answered
### Prepare
You’ll find and collect the data you'll need to answer your questions
### Process
Is when you will clean and organize your data
### Analyze
is when you do the necessary data analysis to uncover answers and solutions
### Share
When you present your findings to decision-makers through a report, presentation, or data visualizations
### Act
In which you and others in the company put the data insights into action



The data analysis process is designed to build on itself, so the results from each step are the inputs for the next step. Keep in mind, however, that you might not always move through the steps linearly. For example, you might be in the analyze phase and find out your data was pulled from the wrong database. Or, you could learn while cleaning the data that your original question didn’t adequately define the problem.

The six phases of the data analysis process help answer business challenges, such as understanding how to improve a retirement program. Additionally, iterating on and reviewing your work throughout the data analysis process is critical for obtaining quality results.

data science, the discipline of making data useful,

is an umbrella term that encompasses three disciplines:

machine learning, statistics, and analytic.

If you want to make a few important decisions under

uncertainty, that is statistics.

If you want to automate, in other words, make many, many,

many decisions under uncertainty,

that is machine learning and AI.

But what if you don't know

how many decisions you want to make before you begin?

What if what you're looking for is inspiration?

You want to encounter your unknown unknowns.

You want to understand your world.

That is analytics.

### Data ecosystems
The various elements that interact with one another to produce, manage, store, organize, analyze, and share data


#### Data science
Creating new ways of modeling and understanding the unknown by using raw data.
"Data scientists create new questions using data, while analysts find answers to existing questions by creating insights from data sources"

#### Data-driven decision-making
Using facts to guide business strategy


### Step by step
1.  **Ask** questions and define the problem.
    
2.  **Prepare** data by collecting and storing the information.
    
3.  **Process** data by cleaning and checking the information.
    
4.  **Analyze** data to find patterns, relationships, and trends.
    
5.  **Share** data with your audience.
    
6.  **Act** on the data and use the analysis results.


#### Gut instinct
Analysts often ask, “How do I define success for this project?”

In addition, try asking yourself these questions about a project to help find the perfect balance:

-   What kind of results are needed?
    
-   Who will be informed?
    
-   Am I answering the question being asked?
    
-   How quickly does a decision need to be made?
##### Key takeaways

Data analysts and detectives share a similar approach to problem-solving, both relying on evidence and facts to make decisions. Data-driven decision-making is essential for analysts, but gut instinct can also play a role in identifying patterns and connections. Balancing data and gut instinct is crucial for making informed decisions, and the right mix depends on the project's goals and time constraints.


  
**"Which analytical skill involves the ability to break things down into smaller steps and work with them in an orderly and logical way?"**
A technical mindset involves breaking things down into smaller steps and working with them in an orderly and logical way. Problem-solving is achieved with analytical skills.


#### Analytical skills
Qualities and characteristics associated with solving problemas using facts

The ones that we are focusing are:
1. Curiosity - Wanting to know something
2. Understanding Context - 
3. Having a technical mindset
4. Data design
5. Data strategy

#### Context
The condition in which something exists or happens.

#### A technical mindset
The ability to break things down into smaller steps or pieces and work with them in an orderly an orderly way.

#### Data design
How you organize information

#### Data strategy
The management of the people, processes and tools used in data analysis.

exploratory data analysis (EDA)

##### Technical mindset
Focusing on implementing a process, regardless of what that looks like, is a great first step to exercising your technical mindset.

##### Data Strategy
Think about a data strategy as a kind of resource allocation—the tools, time, and effort that you put into a project will vary based on what you need to accomplish.


#### Analytical thinking
Identifying and defining a problema and then solving it by using data in an organized, step-by-step manner

#### The five key aspects to analytical thinking
1. Visualization
2. Strategy
3. Problem-orientation
4. Correlation
5. Big-picture and detail-oriented thinking

##### Visualization
The graphical representation of information

##### Strategic
Strategizing helps data analysts see what they want to achieve with the data and how they can get there.

##### Problem-orientation
identify, describe and solve problems. It's all about keeping the problem top of mind throughout the entire project.
##### Correlation
being able to identify a correlation between two or more pieces of data. For example a correlation between a rainier season leading to a high number of umbrellas being sold. But Correlation does not equal causation.
##### Big-picture and detail-oriented thinking
If you only focus on individual pieces, you wouldn't be able to see past that, which is why big-picture thinking is so important.
It helps you zoom out and see possibilities and opportunities.
This leads to exciting new ideas or innovations. On the flip side, detail-oriented thinking is all about figuring out all of the aspects that will help you execute a plan.


#### Some important questions:
- What is the root cause of the problem?
- Where are the gaps in our process?
- What did we not consider before?
This is a great way to think about what information or procedure might be missing from a process, so you can identify ways to make better decisions and strategies moving forward

##### Root cause
The reason why a problem occurs

**Ask, "why" five times to reveal the root cause**
The final answer will gives you some useful and sometimes surprising insights.

##### Gap analysis 
A method for examining and evaluating how a process works currently in order to get where you want to be in the future.

As a data professional, you can turn to the five whys whenever you feel stumped by a problem and need to approach it from a different perspective.

**Dataset:** A collection of data that can be manipulated or analyzed as one unit


#### data analysis tools
- spreadsheets
- databases
- query languages
- visualization software

### The life cycle of data
- Plan
- Capture
- Manage
- Analyze
- Archive
- Destroy

#### Planing
Well before starting an analysis project, a business decides what kind of data it needs, how it will be managed throughout its life cycle, who will be responsible of it, and the optimal outcomes.

#### Capture
This is where data is collected from a variety of different sources and brought into the organization
#### Manage
How and where the data is store, the tools used to keep it safe an secure and the actions taken to make sure that it's maintained properly. Very important to data cleansing.
#### Analyze
Time to data the data, in this phase, the data is used to solve problems, make great decisions and support business goals. 
#### Archive
Storing data in a place where it's still available but may not be used again 
#### Destroy
To destroy the data, the company would use a secure data erasure software
### Database
A collection of data stored in a computer system

## Data life cycle
1.  **Plan:** Decide what kind of data is needed, how it will be managed, and who will be responsible for it.
    
2.  **Capture:** Collect or bring in data from a variety of different sources.
    
3.  **Manage:** Care for and maintain the data. This includes determining how and where it is stored and the tools used to do so.
    
4.  **Analyze:** Use the data to solve problems, make decisions, and support business goals.
    
5.  **Archive:** Keep relevant data stored for long-term and future reference.
    
6.  **Destroy:** Remove data from storage and delete any shared copies of the data.

Govern how data is handled so that it is accurate, secure, and available to meet your organization's needs.


### Data analysis 
The process of analyzing data


# The ask phase
In this phase we define the problem to be solved and we make sure that we fully understand stakeholder expectations.
"What is the purpose of this analysis?"
"What are we hoping to learn from it?"
##### Stakeholders
People who have invested time and resources into a project and are interested in the outcome

##### Defining a problem
Look at the current state and identify how it's different from the ideal state
**Determine who the stakeholders are** in order to understand their expectations.
For example, defining to include all types of risks that could affect the company or just risks related to weather.
## Prepare
different types

of data and how to identify

which kinds of data are most

useful for solving a particular problem.

You'll also discover why it's so important that

your data and results are objective and unbiased.
"We need to be thinking about the type of data we need in order to answer the questions that we've set out to answer based on what we learned when we asked the right questions"

## the process phase
This usually means cleaning data,

transforming it into a more useful format,

combining two or more datasets to make

information more complete and removing outliers,

which are any data points that

could skew the information. This phase is all about getting the details right.
"This is where you get a chance to understand its structure, its quirks , its nuances, and you really get a chance to understand deeply what type of data you're going to be working with and understanding what potential that data has to answer all of your questions"
After cleaning the data and running all the quality assurance checks

## Analyze
involves using tools to transform

and organize that information

so that you can draw useful conclusions,

make predictions, and drive informed decision-making.

"This is the point where we have to take a step back and let the data speak for itself"

## Share phase
Data analyst interpret results and share them with others, to helps stakeholders make effective data-driven decisions.
## Act
"All of this work from asking the right questions to collect your data, to analyzing and sharing doesn't mean much of anything, if we aren't taking action on what we've just learned"


### A function in spreadsheets
A present command that automatically performs a specific process or task using the data in a spreadsheet

### Query language
A computer programming language that allows you to retrieve and manipulate data from a database

### Some popular visualization tools 
- Tableau
- Looker

Depending on which phase of the data analysis process you’re in, you will need to use different tools. For example, if you are focusing on creating complex and eye-catching visualizations, then the visualization tools we discussed earlier are the best choice. But if you are focusing on organizing, cleaning, and analyzing data, then you will probably be choosing between spreadsheets and databases using queries.


**Database:** A collection of data stored in a computer system

**Formula:** A set of instructions used to perform a calculation using the data in a spreadsheet

**Function:** A preset command that automatically performs a specified process or task using the data in a spreadsheet

**Query:** A request for data or information from a database

**Query language:** A computer programming language used to communicate with a database

**Stakeholders:** People who invest time and resources into a project and are interested in its outcome

**Structured Query Language:** A computer programming language used to communicate with a database

**Spreadsheet:** A digital worksheet

**SQL:** (Refer to Structured Query Language)



## Organize your data

One way to organize your data is by sorting it.

1.  Select all columns that contain data. There are a few ways to select multiple cells:
    
    1.  To select nonadjacent cells and/or cell ranges, hold the **Command** (Mac) or **Ctrl** (PC) **key** and select the cells.
        
    2.  To select a range of cells, hold the **Shift** key and either drag your cursor over which cells you want to include or use the arrow keys to select a range.
        
    3.  Select a single cell and drag your cursor over the cells you want to include in your selection.
        
2.  Select the **Data** menu.
    
3.  Select **Sort range**, then select **Advanced range sorting options**.
    
4.  In the **Advanced range sorting options** window, select the checkbox for **Data has header row**. Make sure that **A to Z** is selected.
    
5.  Select the **Sort by** drop-down menu, then select **Siblings**.
    
6.  Select **Sort**. This will organize the spreadsheet by the number of siblings, from lowest to highest.

**The column labels are usually called attributes**
### Attribute 
A characteristic or quality of data used to label a column in a table

**In a dataset, a row is also called an observation**
#### Observation
All of the attributes for something contained in a row of a data table

### Formula 
A set of instructions that performs a specific action using the data in a spreadsheet

## SQL
- Store
- Organize
- Analyze

##### Query
A request for data or information form a database

### Fairness
Ensuring that your analysis doesn't create or reinforce bias



**Best practice**

**Explanation**

**Example**

Consider all of the available data

Part of your job as a data analyst is to determine what data is going to be useful for your analysis. Often there will be data that isn’t relevant to what you’re focusing on or doesn’t seem to align with your expectations. But you can’t just ignore it; it’s critical to consider all of the available data so that your analysis reflects the truth and not just your own expectations.

A state’s Department of Transportation is interested in measuring traffic patterns on holidays. At first, they only include metrics related to traffic volumes and the fact that the days are holidays. But the data team realizes they failed to consider how weather on these holidays might also affect traffic volumes. Considering this additional data helps them gain more complete insights.

Identify surrounding factors

As you’ll learn throughout these courses, context is key for you and your stakeholders to understand the final conclusions of any analysis. Similar to considering all of the data, you also must understand surrounding factors that could influence the insights you’re gaining.

A human resources department wants to better plan for employee vacation time in order to anticipate staffing needs. HR uses a list of national bank holidays as a key part of the data-gathering process. But they fail to consider important holidays that aren’t on the bank calendar, which introduces bias against employees who celebrate them. It also gives HR less useful results because bank holidays may not necessarily apply to their actual employee population.

Include self-reported data

**Self-reporting** is a data collection technique where participants provide information about themselves. Self-reported data can be a great way to introduce fairness in your data collection process. People bring conscious and unconscious bias to their observations about the world, including about other people. Using self-reporting methods to collect data can help avoid these observer biases. Additionally, separating self-reported data from other data you collect provides important context to your conclusions!

A data analyst is working on a project for a brick-and-mortar retailer. Their goal is to learn more about their customer base. This data analyst knows they need to consider fairness when they collect data; they decide to create a survey so that customers can self-report information about themselves. By doing that, they avoid bias that might be introduced with other demographic data collection methods. For example, if they had sales associates report their observations about customers, they might introduce any unconscious bias the employees had to the data.

Use oversampling effectively

When collecting data about a population, it’s important to be aware of the actual makeup of that population. Sometimes, oversampling can help you represent groups in that population that otherwise wouldn’t be represented fairly. **Oversampling** is the process of increasing the sample size of nondominant groups in a population. This can help you better represent them and address imbalanced datasets.

A fitness company is releasing new digital content for users of their equipment. They are interested in designing content that appeals to different users, knowing that different people may interact with their equipment in different ways. For example, part of their user-base is age 70 or older. In order to represent these users, they oversample them in their data. That way, decisions they make about their fitness content will be more inclusive.

Think about fairness from beginning to end

To ensure that your analysis and final conclusions are fair, be sure to consider fairness from the earliest stages of a project to when you act on the data insights. This means that data collection, cleaning, processing, and analysis are all performed with fairness in mind.

A data team kicks off a project by including fairness measures in their data-collection process. These measures include oversampling their population and using self-reported data. However, they fail to inform stakeholders about these measures during the presentation. As a result, stakeholders leave with skewed understandings of the data. Learning from this experience, they add key information about fairness considerations to future stakeholder presentations.

# Ask questions to make Data-Driven Decisions

### Structured thinking
The process of recognizing the current problem or situation, organizing available information, revealing gaps and opportunities, and identifying the options.

The modules
1. Ask Effective questions
2. Make data-driven decisions
3. More spreadsheets basics
4. Always remember the stakeholder

## Step 1: Ask

It’s impossible to solve a problem if you don’t know what it is. These are some things to consider:

-   Define the problem you’re trying to solve
    
-   Make sure you fully understand the stakeholder’s expectations
    
-   Focus on the actual problem and avoid any distractions
    
-   Collaborate with stakeholders and keep an open line of communication
    
-   Take a step back and see the whole situation in context
    

### Questions to ask yourself in this step:

1.  What are my stakeholders saying their problems are?
    
2.  Now that I’ve identified the issues, how can I help the stakeholders resolve their questions?
## Step 2: Prepare

You will decide what data you need to collect in order to answer your questions and how to organize it so that it is useful. You might use your business task to decide:

-   What metrics to measure
    
-   Locate data in your database
    
-   Create security measures to protect that data
    

### Questions to ask yourself in this step:

1.  What do I need to figure out how to solve this problem?
    
2.  What research do I need to do?
## Step 3: Process

Clean data is the best data and you will need to clean up your data to get rid of any possible errors, inaccuracies, or inconsistencies. This might mean:

-   Using spreadsheet functions to find incorrectly entered data
    
-   Using SQL functions to check for extra spaces
    
-   Removing repeated entries
    
-   Checking as much as possible for bias in the data
    

### Questions to ask yourself in this step:

1.  What data errors or inaccuracies might get in my way of getting the best possible answer to the problem I am trying to solve?
    
2.  How can I clean my data so the information I have is more consistent?
## Step 4: Analyze

You will want to think analytically about your data. At this stage, you might sort and format your data to make it easier to:

-   Perform calculations
    
-   Combine data from multiple sources
    
-   Create tables with your results
    

### Questions to ask yourself in this step:

1.  What story is my data telling me?
    
2.  How will my data help me solve this problem?
    
3.  Who needs my company’s product or service? What type of person is most likely to use it?

## Step 5: Share

Everyone shares their results differently so be sure to summarize your results with clear and enticing visuals of your analysis using data via tools like graphs or dashboards. This is your chance to show the stakeholders you have solved their problem and how you got there. Sharing will certainly help your team:

-   Make better decisions
    
-   Make more informed decisions
    
-   Lead to stronger outcomes
    
-   Successfully communicate your findings
    

### Questions to ask yourself in this step:

1.  How can I make what I present to the stakeholders engaging and easy to understand?
    
2.  What would help me understand this if I were the listener?
## Step 6: Act

Now it’s time to act on your data. You will take everything you have learned from your data analysis and put it to use. This could mean providing your stakeholders with recommendations based on your findings so they can make data-driven decisions.

### Questions to ask yourself in this step:

1.  How can I use the feedback I received during the share phase (step 5) to actually meet the stakeholder’s needs and expectations?
    

These six steps can help you to break the data analysis process into smaller, manageable parts, which is called **structured thinking**. This process involves four basic activities:

1.  Recognizing the current problem or situation
    
2.  Organizing available information
    
3.  Revealing gaps and opportunities
    
4.  Identifying your options


### Types of problems
#### Making predictions
Using data to make an informed decision about how things may be in the future
#### Categorizing things
Assigning information to different groups or clusters based on common features
#### Spotting something unusual
Identifying data that is different from the norm
#### Identifying themes
Grouping categorized information into broader concepts
#### Discovering connections
Finding similar challenges faced by different entities and combining data and insights to address them
#### Finding patterns
Using historical data to understand what happened in the past and is therefore likely to happen again


### **Making predictions**

A company that wants to know the best advertising method to bring in new customers is an example of a problem requiring analysts to make predictions. Analysts with data on location, type of media, and number of new customers acquired as a result of past ads can't guarantee future results, but they can help predict the best placement of advertising to reach the target audience.

### **Categorizing things**

An example of a problem requiring analysts to categorize things is a company's goal to improve customer satisfaction. Analysts might classify customer service calls based on certain keywords or scores. This could help identify top-performing customer service representatives or help correlate certain actions taken with higher customer satisfaction scores.

### **Spotting something unusual**

A company that sells smart watches that help people monitor their health would be interested in designing their software to spot something unusual. Analysts who have analyzed aggregated health data can help product developers determine the right algorithms to spot and set off alarms when certain data doesn't trend normally.

### **Identifying themes**

User experience (UX) designers might rely on analysts to analyze user interaction data. Similar to problems that require analysts to categorize things, usability improvement projects might require analysts to identify themes to help prioritize the right product features for improvement. Themes are most often used to help researchers explore certain aspects of data. In a user study, user beliefs, practices, and needs are examples of themes.

By now you might be wondering if there is a difference between categorizing things and identifying themes. The best way to think about it is: categorizing things involves assigning items to categories; identifying themes takes those categories a step further by grouping them into broader themes.

### **Discovering connections**

A third-party logistics company working with another company to get shipments delivered to customers on time is a problem requiring analysts to discover connections. By analyzing the wait times at shipping hubs, analysts can determine the appropriate schedule changes to increase the number of on-time deliveries.

### **Finding patterns**

Minimizing downtime caused by machine failure is an example of a problem requiring analysts to find patterns in data. For example, by analyzing maintenance data, they might discover that most failures happen if regular maintenance is delayed by more than a 15-day window.
