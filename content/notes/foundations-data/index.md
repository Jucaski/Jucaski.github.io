### Prepare
You’ll find and collect the data you'll need to answer your questions
### Process
Is when you will clean and organize your data

The data analysis process is designed to build on itself, so the results from each step are the inputs for the next step. Keep in mind, however, that you might not always move through the steps linearly. For example, you might be in the analyze phase and find out your data was pulled from the wrong database. Or, you could learn while cleaning the data that your original question didn’t adequately define the problem.

The six phases of the data analysis process help answer business challenges, such as understanding how to improve a retirement program. Additionally, iterating on and reviewing your work throughout the data analysis process is critical for obtaining quality results.

data science, the discipline of making data useful,

is an umbrella term that encompasses three disciplines:

machine learning, statistics, and analytic.

If you want to make a few important decisions under

uncertainty, that is statistics.

If you want to automate, in other words, make many, many,

many decisions under uncertainty,

that is machine learning and AI.

But what if you don't know

how many decisions you want to make before you begin?

What if what you're looking for is inspiration?

You want to encounter your unknown unknowns.

You want to understand your world.

That is analytics.

Data ecosystems
The various elements that interact with one another to produce, manage, store, organize, analyze, and share data


#### Data science
Creating new ways of modeling and understanding the unknown by using raw data.
"Data scientists create new questions using data, while analysts find answers to existing questions by creating insights from data sources"

#### Data-driven decision-making
Using facts to guide business strategy
