#### Notes from the book

An important aspect of learning is that include memory, so what we learn is there when we need it.

Learning is an acquired skill.

"Learning is deeper and more durable when it's effortful"

Ways of learning more effectively:
- Retrieve from memory
When learning something new try retrieving it from memory that way you will remember it in long run.

- Solving problems before knowing how to solve them
The more connections you create will help you remember it later.

- Organizing key ideas into mental models
Trying to understand by modeling the concept in your head will help you make more connections.

"Mastery requires both ready knowledge and the conceptual understanding of how to use it"
